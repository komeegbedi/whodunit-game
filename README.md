# whodunit-game
a game that involves deduction to determine the “who, where and how” of a murder. 
Each player makes guesses about the crime, and then other players refute that guess, 
if possible, based on information they have on cards that have been dealt to them. The game "whodunit?" is mildly similar to a well-known boardgame called "Clue".
For a three-minute introduction to the board game Clue, please see this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg_57S4l5Ng

# Game specifications:
"whodunit?" is simpler than Clue. Most notably, there will not be a game board or dice in "whodunit?", so there is no movement in the game. 
Additionally, the players do not take on character identities in the game – players and suspects are separate in "whodunit?". 
The game will thus consist of players taking turns making guesses about the identity of the murderer, the weapon and the location of the murder. 
The first person to guess correctly wins the game. Also in "whodunit?", a turn consists of either a suggestion and an accusation (not both).

# How to Play
* After you run the program, you will be prompted with a question to input how many players you will like to player with (for now this create computer players not extra human players).
* Next you will be able to see the cards given to you
* The goal is to guess the correct suspect, weapon and location the crime happened
